                    <p>I am currently working towards a Master's degree in Government Analytics at Johns Hopkins University. This is my third semester so far and coming into this course with very little coding experience, I've learned a lot about Python's practical usages in the real world and how powerful it is for data analytics. As a CRM Business Analyst at an NGO focusing on international education in Washington D.C., I aspire to continue to gain such coding skills, as I am certain that this will lead to great opportunities in my professional career!</p>

                            <p>The price of tuition in the U.S. has remained fairly steep over the years. Between the 1983-84 and 2013-14 academic years, inflation-adjusted tuition increased by 153% at private four-year colleges and 231% at public four-year universities <a href="https://www.collegeboard.org" target="blank">(College Board)</a>. Tuition costs play a major factor in deciding which college to attend, especially for students from low-income families. While private universities are traditionally thought to be more expensive with their high tuition, recent deep cuts in state funding for public institions has contributed to rising tuition among state universities. The average state is spending 20% less per student in 2015 compared to 2008 <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/" target="blank"> (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities)</a>. In this project, I examine the trends in tuition prices and post-undergraduate debt among low-income families between 4-year private (non-profit) and public universities, in the past two to three years. I seek to identify how much tuition fees have changed and how this compares to changes in grant/scholarship funding from institutional and state governments. I hope that my conclusions can shed light on the factors of increased tuition and fees, as well as provide insight on how college pricing varies between public and private universities. </p>

                            <p>In this project, I analyzed college data available on the web between 2013-2015, through certain techniques used in conjunction with Python. The data collection process consisted of two methods:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li class="left"><strong>Webscraping</strong>: Through Python's <em>BeautifulSoup</em> library and <em>Requests</em> module, I was able to collect information on changes in tuition, and grants/scholarships, specifically, local and institutional grants/scholarships (this data is only available for full-time freshman undergraduates), between the 2013/14 and 2014/15 academic years, via the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/" target="_blank">College Navigator </a>website. The information is scraped from a search query containing pages of college links. Each link provides a table of financial and tuition information for the chosen college. I searched for fairly competitive 4-year public and private (non-profit) colleges with 5%-50% admission rates in the U.S. You may click on <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?s=all&l=93&ct=1&ic=1&an=5&ax=50" target="_blank">public</a> and <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?s=all&l=93&ct=2&ic=1&an=5&ax=50" target="_blank">private </a> to see what search results were produced from these two queries. My Python code iterates over all of the pages, then retrieves tuition, scholarships, and grants data from each of the table's cells. This information is then appended to a dictionary, which is printed out at the end.</li> 
                                <br />
                                <li class="left"><strong>Using json API calls</strong>: Through Python's "requests" module, I was able to attain student debt information from College Scorecard's database, displayed in json format(Source: U.S. Department of Education), containing bulk data of thousands of public and private colleges. I was limited to information from 2013, as this year had more results (perhaps 2014 results have not all been published yet). My Python code called for College Scorecard's API with the field parameter limiting the results to either public or private (non-profit) colleges. With the data in JSON format, I then created a "for-loop", which appended information on median debt, paid by low-income students, to a dictionary. I performed this process for both private and public colleges.</li>

                            <p><a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/" target="_blank">College Scorecard Data
                            </a></p>
                            <p><a href="http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx" target="_blank">National Center for Education Statistics</a></p>
                          
                            <p>After successfully extracting the data from the sources above and methods described in the previous section, I used <em>Sublime Text</em> to restructure my data, and make it compatible for running in <strong>SQLite3</strong>. I created several SQLite databases, sorted by public and private college data, and loaded my data accordingly. Next, as part of my analysis, I created Python files containing SQLite commands to read and analyze each database. From these commands, I was able to determine key summary statistics, including the average amount of grants/scholarships and average percentage of student recipients in the 2013/14 academic year, changes in tuition and net price between the 2013/14 and 2014/15 academic years, and debt among low-income students graduating in 2013. I will provide these statistics in the next few sections.</p>

                            <h2>Final Conclusions</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="static/img/portfolio/6.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Comparing the statistics for fairly competitive U.S. public and private (non-profit) colleges, we can conclude the following information:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="left">Overall, despite recent state cuts in public university funding, private colleges still had a higher net price than public colleges in the 2013-14 academic year, <strong>by $10,811</strong> (for full-time beginning undergraduates). Even more, for low-income students graduating in 2013, those attending private colleges had <strong>$7,926 more in debt.</strong></li>
                                <li class="left">At the same time, we see that <strong>85%</strong> of public schools increased tuition costs between the 2013-14 and 2014-15 academic years, roughly the same rate as that of private schools, at <strong>86%</strong>. Public schools also increased their tuition costs by <strong>1.13%</strong> more than that of private schools between those two academic years. </li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li class="left">Among all private and public colleges, public college tuition increases went up to <strong>39%</strong>, while the highest private college tuition increase was <strong>24%</strong>. However, private tuition decreased as much as <strong>-34%</strong> while public tuition decreased only to <strong>-12%</strong>. This implies that tuition increases are much steeper for public colleges, while tuition decreases are much steeper for private colleges, perhaps this allows private colleges to stay competitive and attract more students.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li class="left">In terms of Grants/Scholarships overall, <strong>5.27% </strong>more students at private colleges had grants/scholarships than at public colleges during the 2013-14 academic year. Furthermore, private colleges disbursed an average of <strong>$12,878</strong> more than public colleges. In terms of grants/scholarships that are institutional-based, there were <strong>30.85%</strong> more private students with institutional grants/scholarships, which were on average <strong>$14,118</strong> higher than those disbursed by public colleges. This makes sense given the higher costs of private colleges, and perhaps more availability of funds, since private schools have a smaller student body.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>It is interesting to note that while private colleges provide a higher amount of grants/scholarships to a larger percent of incoming beginning undergraduates, net tuition is still higher at private colleges. This trickles down to low-income students attending private colleges, as they graduate with almost $8,000 more in debt. Although public colleges have traditionally been viewed as less costly, the gap between public and private college tuition costs clearly is gradually getting narrower, as the percentage of public vs. private colleges with increasing tuition costs was approximately the same in the 2013-14 academic year. Further research could compare these statistics to 5 or even 10 years ago, in order to examine how this gap between public and private college, in terms of tuition, grant/scholarship disbursement, and student debt, have evolved over time.</p>
