# Final-Python-course-website-project- Johns Hopkins

*I created this website as a final project for my Johns Hopkins course "Unleashing Open Data with Python". This website is meant to display the Python skills that I have learned throughout this semester. I use open data from the U.S. Department of Education and the National Center for Education Statistics to analyze trends among private and public colleges and student debt, in order to provide insight on these changes and discrepancies in the past 2-3 years.*
